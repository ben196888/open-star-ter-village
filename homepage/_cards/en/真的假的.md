As one of the projects of Taiwan's open source community, Cofacts established a real time fact-check platform by inviting the general public to collaborate, and applying the technology of chatbot, thereby providing a massive amount of information and reference as well as the technologic support for fact-checking to the public. Cofacts also releases its data that accumulated each time it fact-checks a piece of fake news under CC license. The platform also releases its source code so that people can use it by following its licenses.
