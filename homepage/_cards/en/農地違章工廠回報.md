Disfactory is a project developed by Citizens of the Earth, Taiwan and g0v. Any time citizens report cases of suspected illegal factories on farmland to the system, the data will be forwarded to the competent authority. Citizens stay anonymous but still can keep up with the updates of their reporting and urge the government to regulate illegal factories. The goals of this system are to protect citizens' rights, the environment and food safety through democracy and the rule of law.
