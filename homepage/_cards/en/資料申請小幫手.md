Even if government data has been open for a number of years, citizens are still often unable to access it. The "Data Opener" tool, created by a team of volunteers, analyzes the most common reasons why data requests are denied by the government and modularizes the application process. By doing so, the data helper makes it easier to apply while helping the government understand the importance of open data.
