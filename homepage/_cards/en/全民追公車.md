The prototype of this project is "Bus Tracker Taipei". With data from Taipei and New Taipei City governments and the Public Transport Data eXchange platform established by Taiwanâ€™s Ministry of Transportation and Communications, this app allows users to see bus routes, bus arrival times, as well as the transfer information of airport bus, Taiwan High Speed Rail, Taiwan Railway, YouBike, and other means of public transport. This is one of the best examples of public uses of government open data since 2013.
