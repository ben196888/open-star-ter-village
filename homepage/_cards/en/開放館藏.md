The Open GLAM project was initiated by the Open Knowledge Foundation. It assists cultural institutions (such as art galleries, libraries, archives, and museums) in digitalizing and opening up content and materials through workshops, guidelines, documents, and working groups, hoping to build shared resources of cultural assets.
