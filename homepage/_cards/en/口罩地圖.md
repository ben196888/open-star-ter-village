This app is one of the projects of Taiwan's open source community, g0v. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic that began in 2020, the Taiwanese government adopted a name-based mask-rationing policy to prevent panic buying. However, people didnâ€™t know which pharmacy still had sufficient masks in stock. To address that problem, g0v members established this app by connecting real-time mask stock data from the government-contracted pharmacies, locations of pharmacies and convenient stores that sold masks, and all the necessary information with google map, thereby allowing the public to know the real time amount of mask stock across Taiwan.
