Here are resources players can use for this task: laws as such requiring that governments should enact laws based on the four principles of openness, "easy to access, machine-readable, in an open format, and released under an open license or open usage method." Government ministries should open up internal information for the general public and enterprises to effectively add value to applications. For example, the landform map opened by Taiwan's Ministry of the Interior is used to draw the map that shows the relation between telecommunication signal and landform.
