This is a Chrome browser plug-in that allows users to simultaneously view evaluations of companies, job vacancies, and labor law violation records on the webpages of major job hunting platforms. The plug-in’s automatically-loading comment section allows to leave comments and view previous comments on the company’s recruitment page. This plug-in hopes to create a transperant job hunting ecosystem where labor and management can equally obtain sufficient and authentic information.
