OPass was originally designed as a registration app for the Taiwan Open Source Information Community Seminar. It has been used many times at SITCON (Students’ Information Technology Conference) and COSCUP (Conference for Open Source Coders, Users & Promoters). In order to meet the needs of various events, the integration plan was launched and OPass was thereby born, which continues to optimize sign-up experiences and provides first-hand information of various annual meetings.
