In order to provide citizens with more information before they vote, Johnny Lo started producing "Legislator Voting Guide" and "City and Country Councilor  Voter Guide" in 2013, which compiles data on the legal proposals, voting recording and participation in hearings of candidates in every district up until 2018. In 2019, a group of hackers from g0v expanded this idea and created "Voting Guide for the 2019 Election," which improved the work flow and interface for users and provided more information.
