"Public Money Public Code" is an initiative launched by the "Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE)" in 2017 which advocates that public digital services or systems built by governments and with public money must be released under an open-source license to ensure that new developments of those digital services and systems are not just repeats of existing ones and can facilitate collaboration, thereby allowing everyone to use it. The open letter of this initiative calls on the public to sign the petition, hoping that the system will be applied in all regions.
