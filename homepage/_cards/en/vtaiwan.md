vTaiwan is a platform that allows the public to express their opinions on Taiwanese laws. Legislative and administrative bodies are required to collate the opinions recorded on this platform, include them in the discussion of the policy, and state how the policy reflects the opinion stated or why public opinion was not considered. The platform aims to offer an online open space where stakeholders of a policy can openly discuss with each other and present different points of views. This platform encourages deeper discussion of the topic and promote mutual understanding between civil society and the government.
