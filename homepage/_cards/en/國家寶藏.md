This is one of the projects that received the "Civic Technology Startup Grant" sponsored by the g0v community. With photography software and an online database system, this project calls on volunteers to go to the U.S. Archives and take pictures of historical materials related to Taiwan. The online open database of these files is free for people to use. As of March 2020, the cumulative number of the digitized files has exceeded 200,000.
