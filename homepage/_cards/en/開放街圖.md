The concept of this project inspired by Wikipedia, is to construct a collaborative online map that can be freely drawn and used. The goal is to create a world map with free content that can be edited by everyone. In the beginning, the map was often drawn according to the information that contributors obtained through on-site investigation by using GPS track records, laptops, and many kinds of equipments. Later, aerial and satellite imagery technology also became an important source of data.
