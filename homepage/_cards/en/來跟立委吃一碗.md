Nullfull’s foodmap uses open data to uncover which restaurants South Korea’s legislators are most likely to use national funding to patronize. Although under South Korea's Freedom of Information Act  the public is able to request legislators to release data relating to their budgeting and donations, this information is often released in image files by the national assembly, making it difficult to actually use. Nullfull took this image data, input it into a google spreadsheet at a hackathon, and then used the data related to food to create a map of legislators’ favorite restaurants. Most of the restaurants were luxurious and expensive. To make more people aware of how the government was frivolously spending public money, Nullfull later decided to visit many of these restaurants and take pictures of the food to let Korean people see where their money was being spent.
