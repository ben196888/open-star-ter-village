In the past, actual house prices were only revealed on the basis of the price of each area consisting of a batch of 30 house numbers instead of each house number. In order to make the housing market more transparent, the Ministry of the Interior passed the "Real Price 2.0" amendment, which reveals the price, the house number, and the parcel number of each successful transaction, providing  comprehensive information to future buyers.
