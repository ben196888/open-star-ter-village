Tor, whose name stands for "The Onion Router", is an open-source browser that enhances anonymity on the internet, which also encompasses the function of bypassing internet censorship. It encrypts users' data traffic, passing three Tor nodes as diversions before sending to the target webistes. The target websites wouldn't know the real source of users, and all the three Tor nodes wouldn't know the source and destination of the users at the same time, either, and that's how it achieves anonymity of internet transmission.
