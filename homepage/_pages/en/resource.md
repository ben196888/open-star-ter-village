          "Open StarTer Village" allows you to deeply experience "Open Source"
          projects.


          Have you used the "Bus Tracker Taipei" or perhaps the "Mask Map"? These projects were initiated by the community, rallying partners from different fields like programming, marketing, cultural workers, and more, all contributing their expertise to construct open-source projects.




          The Open Culture Foundation devotes its efforts to promoting and facilitating the development of Taiwan's open-source community, allowing talents from all sides to simultaneously drive social progress, enrich their own skills, and achieve success through the execution of diverse projects.




          By opening resources around the world, more and more people are able to head toward the collective good. Drawing on the power of the crowd, we are also creating a better future.




          May open source be with you!

          **A memo to our next generation**


          We know that open-source projects of different aspects are indispensable in promoting social progress.


          We know that we need to equip ourselves with many skills which schools don't teach us before entering the workforce.


          We know that you deserve a bigger stage and your professional skills need to be seen by more people.


          We know that openness is a must when the world limits your mind.


          We know that we have to think out of the box when universities are only vocational training centers.


          We know that you are definitely more than a labor in the future society.


          **Taiwan's future needs your participation**.


          This time, we will be there.
